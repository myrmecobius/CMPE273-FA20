# Assignment 2: Low code no code
In this assignment, we implement a low code/no code HTTP client that supports scheduled GET calls. The source code can be found in the [httpflow.py](https://github.com/myrmecobius/CMPE273-FA20/blob/master/Assignment2/httpflow.py) file.

The script is run with an input yaml as so:

<pre><code> python3 httpflow.py input.yaml </code></pre>
