# Distributed Key-Value store with Consul
To run, you must have Consul installed and running (docker works too). Please configure setup.py to determine the initial number of nodes. When server_consumer.py is run, it will automatically scan for nodes on consul and take care of threading. Lastly, when client_producer.py is started, it will also scan for the number of available consul nodes and distributed data among them. Client-producer.py will demonstrate Round Robin, HRW Hashing, and Consistent Hashing, in that order. Finally, it will display the functionality of adding and removing nodes from the consul cluster and deal with the data accordingly. Statistics for data density is reported along every step of the way.
